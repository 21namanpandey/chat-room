## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend application locally.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: (LTS version recommended, e.g., v18.x or v20.x)
- **npm or Yarn**: Package managers (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/21namanpandey/chat-room.git
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Configuration
The frontend is configured to connect to a backend server running on `http://localhost:3001`. If your backend is hosted elsewhere, you will need to update the `io()` connection URL in `src/components/ChatRoom.tsx` and the `fetch()` URLs in `src/components/Login.tsx` to point to your backend's address.

### Running the Application
To start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
