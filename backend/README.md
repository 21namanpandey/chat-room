# Real-Time Chat App - Backend

This is the Node.js (Express) backend for the Real-Time Chat project, handling user authentication, chat room management, message persistence, and real-time communication via Socket.io.

## ‚ú® Features

### User Authentication
- Register new users with a username and a mandatory password.
- Login existing users with username and password.
- Generates JWTs for authenticated sessions.

### Chat Room Management
- API to fetch all available chat rooms.
- API to create new chat rooms.

### Message Persistence
- Stores chat messages in a MongoDB database.

### Real-Time Communication
- Socket.io integration for instant message delivery.
- Broadcasts online user lists per room.
- Handles typing indicators.

### Robust Validation
- Uses express-validator for server-side input validation.

## üß∞ Tech Stack
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **Socket.io**: Real-time engine for bidirectional communication.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **bcryptjs**: For hashing passwords securely.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For implementing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
- **dotenv**: For loading environment variables.
- **cors**: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **express-validator**: For robust server-side input validation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the backend application locally.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or Yarn
- MongoDB (running instance)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/21namanpandey/chat-room.git
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Configuration (.env file)
Create a `.env` file in the root of the `chat-backend` directory and add the following environment variables:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/chatapp
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_please_change_this
PORT=3001
```

- **MONGO_URI**: Your MongoDB connection string. If MongoDB is running locally on the default port, the provided URI should work. Otherwise, update it.
- **JWT_SECRET**: **IMPORTANT**: Replace `your_super_secret_jwt_key_please_change_this` with a strong, random, and unique string. This is crucial for the security of your JWTs.
- **PORT**: The port on which the backend server will run.

### Running the Application
To start the backend server:
```bash
npm start
# For development with auto-restarts on file changes:
npm run dev
```

The server will typically run on `http://localhost:3001`.
